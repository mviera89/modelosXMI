  <mainDescription>&lt;p>&#xD;
    Business Process Service Oriented Methodology (BPSOM) provides a guide for service oriented development from business&#xD;
    processes, that can be added as a plug-in to the existing base software development process of the organization. The&#xD;
    objective is to use the way in which people work as the basis for the software development adding specific elements to&#xD;
    guide the generation of services from business processes.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    &amp;nbsp;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;./resources/BPSOMandswprocess80.jpg&quot; width=&quot;600&quot; height=&quot;532&quot; />&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    BPSOM defines activities, deliverables and roles in three key Disciplines: Business Modeling, Design and&#xD;
    Implementation, and a lifecycle based on the Unified Process (UP) to guide the development in an iterative and&#xD;
    incrementally way.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The activities defined in the Business Modeling Discipline emphasize the definition and modeling of business processes&#xD;
    (using the BPMN OMG notation standard) not only as first input for the development process but as key asset of the&#xD;
    organization.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    From these models, the activities defined in the Design Discipline guide the service oriented development by&#xD;
    identifying services from activities, sub-process or complete business processes,&amp;nbsp;specifying them including&#xD;
    interfaces provided and required, parameters,&amp;nbsp;pre and post conditions, among&amp;nbsp;others.&amp;nbsp;&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    A specific activity is defined to reuse existing services in the organization, complete or parcially, then to assign&#xD;
    components to defined services and to specify services interaction, in choreographies or orchestrations depending on&#xD;
    the business process control flow. Finally services realizing business processes, as defined in the Design Discipline,&#xD;
    are implemented in the Implementation Discipline.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    General activities from the base software development process are assumed to exist to carry out needed activities such&#xD;
    as the requirements capture, or the software testing and deployment.&#xD;
