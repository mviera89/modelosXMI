  <mainDescription>&lt;p>
    Business Process Service Oriented Methodology (BPSOM) provides a guide for service oriented development from business
    processes, that can be added as a plug-in to the existing base software development process of the organization. The
    objective is to use the way in which people work as the basis for the software development adding specific elements to
    guide the generation of services from business processes.
&lt;/p>
&lt;p>
    &amp;nbsp;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;./resources/BPSOMandswprocess80.jpg&quot; width=&quot;600&quot; height=&quot;532&quot; />
&lt;/p>
&lt;p>
    BPSOM defines activities, deliverables and roles in three key Disciplines: Business Modeling, Design and
    Implementation, and a lifecycle based on the Unified Process (UP) to guide the development in an iterative and
    incrementally way.
&lt;/p>
&lt;p>
    The activities defined in the Business Modeling Discipline emphasize the definition and modeling of business processes
    (using the BPMN OMG notation standard) not only as first input for the development process but as key asset of the
    organization.
&lt;/p>
&lt;p>
    From these models, the activities defined in the Design Discipline guide the service oriented development by
    identifying services from activities, sub-process or complete business processes,&amp;nbsp;specifying them including
    interfaces provided and required, parameters,&amp;nbsp;pre and post conditions, among&amp;nbsp;others.&amp;nbsp;
&lt;/p>
&lt;p>
    A specific activity is defined to reuse existing services in the organization, complete or parcially, then to assign
    components to defined services and to specify services interaction, in choreographies or orchestrations depending on
    the business process control flow. Finally services realizing business processes, as defined in the Design Discipline,
    are implemented in the Implementation Discipline.
&lt;/p>
&lt;p>
    General activities from the base software development process are assumed to exist to carry out needed activities such
    as the requirements capture, or the software testing and deployment.
